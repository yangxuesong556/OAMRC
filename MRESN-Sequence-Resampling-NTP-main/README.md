# MRESN-Sequence-Resampling-NTP
A sample demo code of Multi-Reservoir Echo State Networks with Sequence Resampling for Nonlinear Time-series Prediction

You will find three simple demos for DeepESN-ESR, DeepESN-LSR, and GroupedESN-ISR on the MGS-17 dataset.
These code can complete the 84-step-ahead prediction task on the MGS-17 but are not well-optimized.

## Requirements:

Pytorch  
Numpy  
Scikit-learn  
Pandas  
Scipy
